	Bernoulli Equation may be interpreted physically to mean that the total mechanical energy is conserved for a control volume:

(a)	What conditions is this relation based upon?
(b)	Please list a few applications of Bernoulli Equation in life.

\item
	In some cases, the use of Bernoulli Equation is invalid. Then how should we extend Bernoulli Equation for these cases?
	
\item
	The siphon can transport the water from the reservoir to irrigation canals. Assume the vertical height $z$ from the highest point to the exit point of the siphon is 6 m and the exit point is 3 m lower than water surface of the reservoir, as shown in figure below. If we need 100 $m^3$ of water per hour, try to determine the diameter of the siphon d. If the temperature of water is 20 ℃ (the saturated vapor pressures of water is 2340 Pa accordingly), and the local atmospheric pressure is 1.0133×105 Pa, determine whether the siphon can transport water normally.

\item
	The Stokes number, $St$, used in particle-dynamics studies, is a dimensionless combination of five variables: acceleration of gravity $g$, viscosity $\mu$, density $\rho$, particle velocity $U$, and particle diameter $D$. (a) If $St$ is proportional to $\mu$ and inversely proportional to $g$, find its form. (b) Show that $St$ is actually the quotient of two more traditional dimensionless groups.

\item
	A pendulum has an oscillation period $T$ which is assumed to depend upon its length $L$, bob mass m, angle of swing $\theta$, and the acceleration of gravity. A pendulum 1 m long, with a bob mass of 200g, is tested on earth and found to have a period of 2.04s when swinging at 20°. (a) What is its period when it swings at 45°? A similarly constructed pendulum, with $L = 30$ cm and $m$ = 100 g, is to swing on the moon ($g$ = 1.62 m/s2) at $\theta$ = 20°. (b) What will be its period?
	
\item
	Use dimensional analysis to determine the energy $E$ released in an intense point blast if the blastwave propagation distance $D$ into an undisturbed atmosphere of density $\rho$ is known as a function of time $t$ following the energy release.
\item
	To good approximation, the thermal conductivity k of a gas depends only on the density ρ, mean free path l, gas constant R, and absolute temperature T. For air at 20°C and 1 atm, k ≈ 0.026 W/m K and k ≈ 6.5E8 m. Use this information to determine k for hydrogen at 20°C and 1 atm if $l \approx$ 1.2E-7 m.
\item
		A student needs to measure the drag on a prototype of characteristic length $d_p$ moving at velocity $U_p$ in air at sea-level conditions. He constructs a model of characteristic length $d_m$, such that the ratio $d_p/d_m = a$ factor $f$. He then measures the model drag under dynamically similar conditions, in sea-level air. The student claims that the drag force on the prototype will be identical to that of the model. Is this claim correct? Explain.
